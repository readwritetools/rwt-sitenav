	<tr><td>The <span class=product>rwt-sitenav</span> web component is a pull-out website navigation menu, with subtle hamburger button, and default activation of the menu item for the current page.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Sometimes you need to provide your website visitors with quick access to a large
quantity of pages without cluttering the main reading area of the page.

The <span>rwt-sitenav</span> web component does this by keeping the menu
off the left-hand side of the page until the user needs it. The menu is
activated, sliding over the page content, when the user clicks on the hamburger
menu button. Activation may also be initiated through the component's `toggleMenu`
method or through its event interface.

The component has these features:

   * The hamburger menu button is subtly displayed along the left-hand margin,
      appearing brighter on hover.
   * The first few times that a visitor interacts with your website, the menu button
      pulses to draw attention to itself.
   * The menu scrolls vertically, accommodating any number of menu items.
   * Menu items may be kept separate from the web component, allowing the webmaster
      to change its contents in a single centralized place. Alternatively, menu items
      may be slotted directly between the component's opening and closing tags.
   * The menu item corresponding to the current page is highlighted and scrolled into
      view when the page is first loaded.
   * The menu has an event interface for showing and hiding itself.
   * The menu emits a custom event to close sibling menus and dialog boxes.
   * A keyboard listener is provided to allow a shortcut key to open/close the menu.

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-sitenav</span> web component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. Templates are written using  notation, which can
be compiled into HTML using the free <a href='https://hub.readwritetools.com/desktop/rwview.blue'>Read Write View</a>
desktop app. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and installation are
done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Installation using NPM

If you are familiar with Node.js and the `package.json` file, you'll be
comfortable installing the component just using this command:

```bash
npm install rwt-sitenav
```

If you are a front-end Web developer with no prior experience with NPM, follow
these general steps:

   * Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a>
on your development computer.
   * Create a `package.json` file in the root of your web project using the command:
```bash
npm init
```

   * Download and install the web component using the command:
```bash
npm install rwt-sitenav
```


Important note: This web component uses Node.js and NPM and `package.json` as a
convenient *distribution and installation* mechanism. The web component itself
does not need them.

#### Installation using Github

If you are more comfortable using Github for installation, follow these steps:

   * Create a directory `node_modules` in the root of your web project.
   * Clone the <span>rwt-sitenav</span> web component into it using the
      command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-sitenav.git
```


### Using the web component

After installation, you need to add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it.

   * Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-sitenav.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-sitenav/rwt-sitenav.js' type=module></script>             
```

   * Add the component tag somewhere on the page.

      * For scripting purposes, apply an `id` attribute.
      * Apply a `sourceref` attribute with a reference to an HTML file containing the
         menu's text and any CSS it needs.
      * Optionally, apply a `shortcut` attribute with something like `F9`, `F10`, etc. for
         hotkey access.
      * For WAI-ARIA accessibility apply a `role=navigation` attribute.
      * For simple menus, the `sourceref` may be omitted and the menu hyperlinks may be
         slotted into the web component. Simply place the hyperlinks directly between the
`<rwt-sitenav>` and `</rwt-sitenav>` tags.
```html
<rwt-sitenav id=sitenav sourceref='/menu.html' shortcut=F9 role=navigation></rwt-sitenav>
```


#### Menu template

The content and format of the menu is not prescribed. You may add hyperlinks
with formatting that matches your website. Still, one important guideline to
keep in mind is that the text of each menu item should be short so that it
doesn't wrap into multiple lines. If necessary, the width of the panel can be
adjusted using the component's `--width` CSS variable.

The easiest way to start building your menu is to follow this pattern, which
uses list items `li` for individual pages, and headings `h2` for grouping similar
pages.

```html
<h2><a href='/products.html' >Products</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href='/products/grappling-hooks.html'>Grappling hooks</a></li>
    <li><a href='/products/ropes.html'>Ropes</a></li>
    <li><a href='/products/carabiners.html'>Carabiners</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href='/services.html' >Services</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href='/services/training.html'>Training</a></li>
    <li><a href='/services/certification.html'>Certification</a></li>
</ul>
```

#### Self identification

The menu item corresponding to the current page can be highlighted when it
identifies itself to the menu. This is accomplished by adding a `meta` tag to the
page that contains the short-form URL of the page itself. For example, if the
page's full URL is `https://example.com:443/services.html` the shortform URL would
be `/services.html`.

The short-form URL may be added to any of three special-purpose `meta` tags, like
this:

```html
<meta name=sitenav:level1 content='/services.html' />
<meta name=sitenav:level2 content='/services/certification.html' />
<meta name=sitenav:level3 content='/services/certification/instructor.html' />
```

The three items correspond to the artificial hierarchical depth of the menu
items. When the page is first loaded, the web component uses the content
attribute of these meta tags as search terms, looking for the menu item with a
matching anchor `href`. When found, that menu item is highlighted and scrolled
into view.

The search for a corresponding `href` is conducted starting with the deepest
level, going from `sitenav:level3` to `sitenav:level2` to `sitenav:level1`.

Continuing with the previous example, if the current page is `https://example.com:443/services.html`
, then this menu item will be highlighted:

```html
<h2><a href='/services.html' >Services</a></h2>
```

### Customization

#### Menu size and position

When visible, the menu is absolutely positioned along the left-hand side of the
viewport. Its position and size may be overridden using CSS by defining new
values for the top, bottom, and width variables.

```css
rwt-sitenav {
    --top: 0;
    --bottom: 0;
    --width: 15.5rem;
}
```

#### Menu color scheme

The default color palette for the menu uses a dark mode theme. You can use CSS
to override the variables' defaults:

```css
rwt-sitenav {
    --background: var(--nav-black);
    --level1-color: var(--title-blue);
    --level2-color: var(--pure-white);
    --accent-color: var(--yellow);
    --accent-background: var(--pure-black);
}
```

### Event interface

The menu can be controlled with its event interface.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `toggle-sitenav` messages. Upon receipt
it will show or hide the menu.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `keydown` messages. If the user presses
the configured shortcut key (<kbd>F9</kbd>, <kbd>F10</kbd>, etc) it will
show/hide the menu. The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key hides the menu.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `collapse-popup` messages, which are
sent by sibling menus or dialog boxes. Upon receipt it will close itself.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `click` messages. When the user clicks
anywhere outside the menu, it closes itself.
